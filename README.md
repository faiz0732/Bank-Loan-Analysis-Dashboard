# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis & Credit Risk Dashboard
An end-to-end financial analytics project using Excel, SQL and Power BI to analyze loan performance, repayment behavior, and default risk

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Bank Loan Analytics initiative focused on analyzing customer loan data to understand loan disbursement patterns, repayment performance, credit risk, and borrower behavior.
The project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow — from raw CSV data and SQL-based data preparation to interactive dashboards in Power BI — enabling data-driven decision-making for banking and financial institutions.

## 💡 Key Findings & Business Insights

### 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Grade-based Risk Pattern:** Lower credit grades (E–G) show significantly higher default rates compared to higher-grade borrowers (A–B).

2. **Verification Impact:** Verified customers contribute a higher share of total repayments, indicating stronger credit reliability.

3. **Geographical Concentration:** Certain states account for a disproportionately high number of charged-off loans, highlighting regional credit risk.

4. **Seasonal Trends:** Loan issuance and default patterns vary month-wise, suggesting seasonal borrowing behavior.

5. **Home Ownership Influence:** Homeowners generally demonstrate better repayment performance compared to renters and others.

### 📌 Actionable Recommendations

1. Strengthen approval criteria for **low-grade loans** to reduce default exposure.

2. Promote **income verification** to improve repayment quality.

3. Monitor **state-wise credit risk** and introduce targeted lending policies.

4. Adjust lending strategies based on **seasonal borrowing trends.**

5. Design **customized loan products** based on home ownership profiles.
